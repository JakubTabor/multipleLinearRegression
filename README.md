# multipleLinearRegression
# This is my first multiple linear regression model
# in the part ('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [3]) I make it only on 3 line which is state
# I split data in to train and test set 
# Then set "test_size" to (0.2) of total data, "random_state" at (0) to exclude random results
