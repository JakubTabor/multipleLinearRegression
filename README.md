# multipleLinearRegression
# This is my first multiple linear regression model
# in the part ('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [3]) I make it only on 3 line which is state
# I split data in to train and test set 
# Then set "test_size" to (0.2) of total data, "random_state" at (0) to exclude random results
# (regressor.fit(X_train, Y_train)) i train my data
# Finally i can make predictions and assign it into "y_pred" """y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)"""
# And reshape my results into pretty columns """y_pred.reshape(len(y_pred)"""
